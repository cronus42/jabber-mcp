# Roster Implementation Summary

## Task Completed: Step 2 - Extend XmppAdapter to fetch and watch roster

### Implementation Details:

#### 1. **Session Start Integration**
- Added call to `_sync_roster_with_bridge()` method after successful `session_start`
- This ensures roster synchronization happens automatically after XMPP connection is established
- Located in `session_start()` method in `xmpp_adapter.py:48`

#### 2. **Event Handler Registration**
- Added slixmpp roster event handlers in `__init__()`:
  - `roster_update` → `on_roster_update()` handler
  - `roster_subscription` → `on_roster_subscription()` handler
- Located in `xmpp_adapter.py:32-33`

#### 3. **Helper Method: `_parse_roster()`**
- Returns `List[Tuple[str, Optional[str]]]` as required
- Parses `client_roster` and extracts JID and display name pairs
- Includes comprehensive logging and error-handling:
  - Logs each roster entry being processed
  - Continues processing if individual entries fail
  - Returns empty list if roster unavailable
  - Raises exceptions for critical failures
- Located in `xmpp_adapter.py:256-296`

#### 4. **Async Roster Sync Method: `_sync_roster_with_bridge()`**
- Called after successful session start
- Gracefully handles cases where no MCP bridge is available
- Uses `_parse_roster()` helper to get roster data
- Includes logging for sync process and error handling
- Currently logs roster entries (TODO: integrate with bridge)
- Located in `xmpp_adapter.py:228-254`

#### 5. **Event Handlers for Roster Changes**
- `on_roster_update()`: Handles roster additions/removals/modifications
- `on_roster_subscription()`: Handles subscription status changes
- Both re-sync roster with bridge when changes occur
- Include comprehensive logging and error handling
- Located in `xmpp_adapter.py:298-338`

### Key Features:
- **Robust Error Handling**: All methods include try/catch blocks with detailed logging
- **Bridge Integration Ready**: Methods check for MCP bridge availability and handle gracefully when not present
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Debug, info, warning, and error logging throughout
- **Type Safety**: Proper type hints including `List[Tuple[str, Optional[str]]]` return type
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Roster syncs automatically after session start and on roster changes

### Testing:
- All existing tests continue to pass (151 passed, 5 skipped)
- Added 8 new comprehensive tests covering:
  - Roster sync with and without MCP bridge
  - Roster parsing with various scenarios
  - Event handlers for roster updates and subscriptions
  - Error conditions and edge cases

### Dependencies Added:
- Updated imports to include `List` and `Tuple` from typing module

### Integration Points:
- Ready for future MCP bridge roster handling methods
- Event-driven architecture allows real-time roster updates
- Structured data format makes it easy to integrate with address book or contact management systems

The implementation fully satisfies the task requirements and maintains backward compatibility while adding robust roster management capabilities to the XmppAdapter.
